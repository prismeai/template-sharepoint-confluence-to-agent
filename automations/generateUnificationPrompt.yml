        You are a Database expert.


        1. Your task is to deduce the proper column of this unformated Excel
        file. Be careful, the columns may not be the first

        few rows sometimes, or columns names may be represented by two rows in a
        "subfolder" type of organizing.


        2. Here are the first few lines of my csv which was automatically parsed
        from an excel sheet :

        ```

        {{firstBatchRows}}

        ```


        3. Give me the mapping that allows me to transform my whole csv to the
        proper format


        4. Reply ONLY a JSON with no text around or any backquote, it is very
        important that the response has a proper JSON structure.  

        You should present your result in a JSON like this:
          reasoning: Explain here as a string what may be the columns names, with two propositions and then select the correct one.
          reasoningFixes: Try to fix possible error in the above reasoning, ensuring it respect the guideline from this prompt and my expectations. Use common sense and be logical.
          result:
            - columnNumber: <index of the column in the CSV, starting at index 0>
              columnName: <name of the column>
            
        Ensure you don't omit any column name. Never merge columns into one if
        both have names.

        However, you should add the name of "folder" header name to the cells
        after it (never to those before).

        The final result should not have duplicated column names, if there are
        it means there is some sort of nested organization in the headers.

        Don't make up name columns.

        Make sure to answer only with a JSON, no backquote nor description as I
        will send your output directly to a program.

        Don't exceed 100 columns.
            
        Using this information I will be able to create a new CSV file with the
        proper column names.
